# Deep-Learning---Part-1
Deep learning is the hot modelling technique and the part 1 of this learning will walk through the basics of simple neural network layer. Further the deep network will be build

Steps:

1) Start with numpy basics in python
2) Logistic regression as neural network
3) Working planar data
4) Buildidng step by step deep network
5) Application of deep network
